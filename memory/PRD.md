# Ace Chasers — PRD

## Original problem statement
Full-stack disc-golf social platform: React/FastAPI/MongoDB with League Ops, real-time round scoring, compliance, PWA/TWA, and UDisc-style scorecard grid.

## Current state (Feb 2026)
Enterprise-grade League Management platform:
- **Formats**: Singles, Random-Draw Doubles, BYOP, Team, Match Play (single-elimination bracket with auto-advance)
- Firebase Auth, real-time WebSockets, offline-first score entry (client + server idempotency)
- Manager quick-start, DM, broadcast, feed moderation, pinned schedule announcements
- Real QR self-enroll, pre-finalization simulator with two share-card templates
- Founder-Sponsor referral engine, format-aware leaderboards
- Bracket seeding with **drag-free reorder + lock + shuffle** override, auto-advance on scorecard finalize
- Team scramble one-shared-score with server-side dedup
- **Phase 4 router split complete** — all `/rounds/*` and `/scorecards/*` endpoints live in `leagues_rounds_router.py`
- Cloudflare-fronted Android PWA/TWA

## Implemented in this session (Feb 2026)

### Prior passes (summary)
- P0 completed-scorecard PDF layout, offline-first, welcome, server idempotency
- QR self-enroll, simulator, DM, moderation, schedule publisher, referral, share cards
- Match Play bracket, team scramble, dual share-card templates, Phase-4 partial (scorecard endpoints)

### This pass (Items 1, 2, 3)
- **ITEM 1 · Auto-advance on scorecard finalize** — new `_maybe_advance_bracket_on_finalize()` runs inside `finalize_scorecard`. Locates the open bracket match containing the finalizer, and when both cardmates on the round are finalized, resolves the winner (lowest total wins) and slots them into the linked next-tier match. Ties → returns `{tied: True}` so the director can call the manual report endpoint. Response now includes `bracket_advance: {pending|resolved|tied}`. Broadcasts a `bracket_advance` WebSocket event.
- **ITEM 2 · Phase-4 completion** — moved 8 endpoints out of `leagues_router.py` into `leagues_rounds_router.py` via a controlled Python-scripted extraction:
  * `GET /api/rounds/{round_id}`
  * `PATCH /api/rounds/{round_id}/status`
  * `POST /api/rounds/{round_id}/cards`
  * `POST /api/rounds/{round_id}/join`
  * `POST /api/rounds/{round_id}/finalize` (director sweep-finalize)
  * `POST /api/rounds/{round_id}/auto-pair`
  * `GET /api/rounds/{round_id}/payout`
  * `POST /api/rounds/{round_id}/finalize-payout`
  * `_csv_response` helper stayed in `leagues_router.py` (only CSV export endpoints consume it there)
  * `leagues_router.py` slimmed from ~1731 → ~1467 lines. `leagues_rounds_router.py` grew to a coherent Round-and-Scorecard surface.
- **ITEM 3 · Seed override UI** — new `SeedManagementPanel.jsx` mounted from `BracketView`. Directors can:
  * Reorder seeds with per-row ↑/↓ buttons (accessible on touch devices; no drag-lib dependency)
  * **Lock** individual seeds so shuffle skips them
  * **Shuffle unlocked** for random draw honoring locked positions
  * Generate the bracket from the exact resulting order
  * Also available on an existing bracket via the "Re-seed" button

## Backlog (P1/P2)
- **P2 — Division-scoped share cards** — one Leaderboard card per division for multi-division leagues.
- **P2 — Bracket seeding by rating** — pull rating from `_compute_handicap` snapshot to preseed order automatically.
- **P2 — Tie-break flow inside auto-advance** — director prompt UI when the hook returns `tied: True`.
- **P2 — Rounds route consolidation** — some CSV round-exports still live in `leagues_router.py`; a follow-up could co-locate them.

## Backend endpoints (this pass)
- `POST /api/scorecards/{id}/finalize` (extended response with `bracket_advance`)
- (moved, same URLs) 8 `/rounds/*` endpoints now handled by `leagues_rounds_router.py`

## Key files touched this session
- `/app/backend/routers/leagues_router.py` (extracted 8 endpoints; kept `_csv_response`)
- `/app/backend/routers/leagues_rounds_router.py` (accepts extracted endpoints + auto-advance hook)
- `/app/frontend/src/components/SeedManagementPanel.jsx` (new)
- `/app/frontend/src/components/BracketView.jsx` (wires SeedManagementPanel for seed + re-seed)
- `/app/backend/tests/test_iteration39.py` (new — 1 comprehensive E2E test)

## Testing
- iteration39 → 1/1 pass (E2E: Match Play seed → active → both scorecards → auto-advance resolution + winner persisted; Phase-4 endpoints all reachable)
- iteration38 → 5/5 pass alongside iteration39 (6/6 combined)
- iteration36 + iteration37 individually green (Firebase Identity rate limits IP-wide bursts occasionally, unrelated to code)
